# Track

I like to track my weight by logging it in an app every morning.

I currently use Libra, which works fine.

But I don't like the way it visualizes the data. I don't like the ads. And I'd rather have my data in a database in my control, in case I ever want to do any long-running quantified self stuff in the future.

I want to use rust more, because it seems like a great language. So I'll build as much of it as I can in rust.

I would like to access it on my phone, but also from any other device. Ideally, it would work offline in case my internet is out for whatever reason.

# TODO

- [x] Save/get weight from database
- [ ] Create an API that allows me to POST / GET weights
- [ ] Make accessible online
